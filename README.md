I've changed the following behaviours in OSX

- Change tap to press - By default I need to press to press ðŸ™„
- Show only active items in dock - I don't like clutter.
- Increase keyrepeat and delay keyrepeat delay - I assume most devs like it this way.
- Add bottom right corner as hot corner for locking screen

## Optional

Following are optional scripts which can be run based on your need. I recommended reading through these scripts to understand what they do and what you need before running them.

### Mac defaults

You can also customise some Mac settings using the `defaults` command. I've set a few which are common for most of us. You can refered to this [repo1](https://github.com/kevinSuttle/macOS-Defaults/blob/master/.macos) & [repo2](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/master/.macos) more a ton of other stuff that can be achieved.

I've changed the following behaviours in OSX

- Change tap to press - By default I need to press to press ðŸ™„
- Show only active items in dock - I don't like clutter.
- Increase keyrepeat and delay keyrepeat delay - I assume most devs like it this way.
- Add bottom right corner as hot corner for locking screen

The osx.sh file contains the commands for above. If you used the install script then go to `/opt/frog-mac-starter` to find the osx.sh file and run it there. 

### Git defaults

The git.sh script can help you to set some standard git defaults like you full name and email into the config. It also configures some aliases and creates a SSH key which can be used to authenticate yourselve.
